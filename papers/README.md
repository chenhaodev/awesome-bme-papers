### acc.dataset.sum.pdf
highlights the application of deep learning in sensor-based activity recognition, progress in the field, paper structure, literature review, and future research challenges.

### acc.fall.func-test.sum.pdf
Complete inventory of functional tests employed, accompanied by brief explanations and their usage frequency in the surveyed papers, including "Timed Up and Go Test," "Tinetti Test or Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment," "Sit-to-Stand," among others, ending with "Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)." 

### acc.index.math.pdf
The text outlines a technique for combining the fluctuations of raw acceleration signals across three axes (x, y, and z), followed by normalisation of this total using systematic noise variance to develop an activity index (AI). A validation box plot illustrates the AI for various activities such as watching a DVD, assembling a puzzle, washing dishes, doing laundry, mopping, walking, and using a treadmill at varying speeds (TM15, TM20, TM25).

### acc.sleep-awake.arch.pdf
The schematic presents a method for analyzing data to identify total sleep opportunity (TSO), classify sleep/wake states, and evaluate sleep quality using wearable or monitoring devices. It describes a process from data preprocessing to sleep/wake classification, including non-wear detection, TSO calculation, and the application of various algorithms and rules at each stage. Key elements of this flowchart include the use of high-pass filters, activity index calculations, and Webster's Reconsolidation Rules for sleep detection, alongside techniques like downsampling, temperature-based non-wear detection, and identifying continuous activity or rest periods.

### chf.index.dev.sum.pdf
LACE Index calculates the risk of death or unplanned readmission within 30 days post-discharge, scoring based on length of stay, admission type (acute/emergent), Charlson comorbidity index, and emergency department visits in the last six months. Points per attribute generate a patient's LACE score to assess risk.

### ecg.dl.sum.pdf
The diagram showcases BeatNet and RhythmNet, two deep learning models for ECG analysis, based on a modified pre-activation ResNet for 1D classification. It depicts layers as blocks in a vertical arrangement, with BeatNet and RhythmNet compressing data 7x and 9x, respectively. The blocks represent operations such as convolution, normalization, and activation, ending with a softmax layer for classification.

### eda.ml-feat.sum.pdf
The table enumerates physiological metrics like ECG, SC, EMG, BP, and others, highlighting key features for each, such as ECG's "Mean HR" for average heart rate and SC's "SCR duration" for the skin conductance response time.

### eda.pattern.intro.pdf
The graph aims to show skin conductance responses to stimuli over time, highlighting important metrics like latency, rise time, and amplitude for SCR analysis. These are vital for studying physiological reactions to emotions, cognitive activities, or events in psychophysiological research.

### fall-risk.model.pdf
Research paper on gait analysis, detailing the use of formulas to measure walking parameters like cadence, stride time/length, stance phase, and gait asymmetry. It explains filtering gait data with filter, detecting heel strikes/toe-offs via acceleration, and presents specific formulas for each parameter. Additionally, it discusses normalising for factors like height and incorporates variables such as age, sex, BMI, and physical activity into its analysis.

### voice.ml-arch.sum.pdf
The image depicts a speech analysis process integrating linguistic and acoustic elements within an AI classification algorithm. It begins with Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and voice recording. Linguistically, it involves annotating recognized text like "Luxembourg is a resolutely multilingual environment" with parts of speech and parsing, plus extracting features such as speech rate and noun frequency. These linguistic details contribute to a feature set for AI classification. Acoustically, the process includes silence removal, signal framing, and analysis using Windowing, FFT, and MFCC, generating acoustic feature vectors.
